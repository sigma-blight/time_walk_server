BRISBANE, Sunday, 5 p.m.
 
The water rose gradually all last night and until 3 p.m. to-day, when it was 8 inches below the mark of the great flood a of a fortnight ago. The flood is now slowly subsiding.
 
Three fatalities are reported thus far Sydney Hollyman, 18 years, a deaf mute employed in the Civil Service grocery stores, Edward-street, was found drowned; 
a lad named Thomas E. Patton, aged 11 years, was drowned at Paddington; and the body of a child was found floating in Moreton Bay. It is expected other fatalities will be re ported as communication is restored.
 
The water in Queen-street this morning was 7 feet deep at the intersection of Edward-street.
 
A terrific tornado was experienced in Moreton Bay and on its shores on Friday, but it only lasted for a short time. It burst into Canoona Creek, sending the water 40 feet high.
 
The steamers Paluma and Elamang and the hulk Marie Evans have all been floated out of the Botantical Gardens. Pettigrew's old steamer, the Tadoraah Rajah, sank at the wharf last night.
 
The steam launch Midge to-day took a quantity of flour to Oxley in consequence of the receipt of information that the residents were well-nigh starving.
 
Queen-street last night presented a weird scene. A stretch of water 200 yards in width lay at the intersection of Edward-street, and there was a similar expanse at the intersection - of Creek street Boats were not allowed to ply after dark. 
The scene was dismal, the only relief being an occasional lantern, attached to a cord or rope, marking the limits of the water.
 
The scene, as viewed from Spring Hill to day, was one of utter desolation. Looking along Edward-street, there was one stretch of water from Charlotte-street right across the Botanical Gardens to Kangaroo Point
 
Several hundred houses were sub merged at West End and many scores at Kangaroo Point.
 
There is a feeling of relief now that the water is subsiding.
