DESTRUCTION OF THE VICTORIA BRIDGE
 
The worst fears which were entertained for the safety of the Victoria Bridge have been realised, 
as we have already briefly announced for it is our painful duty to record the fact that the structure has been completely wrecked. 
The disaster took place about 4 a.m. on Monday at which time there was a crowd gathered on the dry land at the bridge approaches. 
Gallantly as the structure had resisted the enormous weight of water rushing against it all day, when the first inroad was made it soon succumbed. 

The first portion to go was the second or third span, where the flood waters had probably been running the strongest. 
There was one loud crash, which shook the very earth, and made the surrounding buildings shake to their foundations; one convulsive heave and the wrecked portion went down the river. 
Soon after pieces followed it, until before half an hour had elapsed fully one-half of the bridge had disappeared. The waters did their work completely. 
No disjointed masonry was left standing; not twisted iron work and broken woodwork marked the spot where the structure once stood. 
Of the northern half of the bridge not a vestige was left. The structure had broken off almost in the centre as sharp and as clean as it could have been by workmen employed for the purpose. 
With the destruction of the bridge the telegraph and telephone wires, and gas and water pipes went down, so that communication will have to be carried on by means of boats.
