The Central Railway Station
 
Sir - Will you permit me to call the attention of the Railway Commissioners to the up and down platforms of the Central Station. 
The up platform can boast the partial shelter against the sun and rain, but there is absolutely none on the down platform, 
and the crowds fo passengers (daily increasing) which use them can speak very feelingly of their suffering from the sun.
 
What will they think, what language will they use when the rain catches them? 
I consider such a state of affairs is discreditable and intolerable to the travelling public, and will seriously affect the traffic.
 
...
 
I would suggest to the commissioners that they should supply more seating accommodation. Ladies and children are seriously inconvenienced for want of it. 
The few seats now on the station are generally filled by young fellows who do not show much chivalrous regard to the necessities of their mother's sex.
I think a few more porters should also be employed to assist passengers with their luggage and give them any information they require ... 
they introduction into this colony of those arrangements would be an immense boon to the travelling public ...
