The City Halt tower continues to he a source of attraction to hundreds of people who did not leave the city during the holidays, and the daily takings this week have averaged about £10.
 
Besides visiting the rower, a number of the visitors viewed the concert hall, which was left open for inspection, but as only a skeleton staff was working during the holidays the reception rooms and council chamber were closed.
 
The absence of a guide or indication signs on the tower have been commented on by a number of the visitors, who suggested that with better organisation and effective noticed the takings at the lift would be doubled.
