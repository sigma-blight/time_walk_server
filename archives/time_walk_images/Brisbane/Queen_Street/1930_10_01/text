Tram traffic in Queen-street has increased considerably as a result of the temporary transfer of outward bound trams, which usually traverse Adelaide-street, to the main thoroughfare. 
The change was necessitated by the relaying of tram tracks in Adelaide-street, which is being widened between Albert and George streets.
 
The general manager of the tramways department (Mr. G. R. Steer) said on Saturday that tramway officers and the police had co-operated to prevent undue delay or inconvenience. 
At present, when no outbound cars from the Itaca district were running in Adelaide-street, the number of trams passing along the post office side of Queen-street between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m. was 188, the average head room being 19 seconds.
That was much the same as in George-street, Sydney, where the average head room between the cars at the peak periods of the afternoon was 18 seconds.
