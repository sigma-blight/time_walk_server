A photo of Brisbane's Queen's St taken by A Lomer & Co, whose studio was open in the city between 1874 and 1905.
 
Do you spot the sign for Gordon and Gotch? John Gotch migrated to Australia, intent on striking it rich with the gold rush, in December 1853. Sadly his quest for gold failed to deliver and Gotch began selling newspapers for Alexander Gordon, that became a business partnership.
 
When Gordon returned back to Scotland in 1859, Gotch took over the business, which was, by then, the main importer of newspapers and magazines from. In 1875 Gordon & Gotch opened their Brisbane office, in time for Albert Lomer's camera to capture them in this photo!
