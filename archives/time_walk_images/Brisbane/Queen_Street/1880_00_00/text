The Eagle Street Drinking Fountain was completed in 1880 as part of a Council beautification project. 
The then Municipal Council funded the majority of the work and the remainder of the funds required was raised by public subscription. 
However, there was confusion as to the original purpose of the fountain, as donations were also being sought around the same time for a memorial to James Mooney, a young volunteer fireman who died in 1877 in the line of duty.
 
Although an official Mooney memorial was erected above his grave in Toowong Cemetery, the Eagle Street Drinking Fountain became inextricably linked with the young fireman.
